## At a glance
- ‚úÖ **One studio** for Tradera, Blocket, Facebook Marketplace, and eBay
- ‚úÖ **AI descriptions** (Minimal / Simple / Detailed), Swedish tone, safe formatting
- ‚úÖ **Modern image manager:** drag & drop, rotate, reorder, set cover, client‚Äëside compression
- ‚úÖ **Per‚Äëplatform status** (Open / Klar) and a single **Sold** toggle to close the loop
- ‚úÖ **No login** ‚Äî drafts + images persist in your browser (LocalStorage)

## Why
Selling the same item on several marketplaces is slow: different forms, formats, and copy rules.  
AnnonsV√§n Pro removes the repetition ‚Äî type once, drop your images, let AI help with the copy, then open each marketplace with everything ready.

---

## How it works
1. **Fill in basics** ‚Äî title, price, condition (and optional city/notes).  
2. **Add photos** ‚Äî drop images; they are compressed on-device and you can reorder, rotate, and pick a cover.  
3. **Generate copy with AI** ‚Äî choose Minimal / Simple / Detailed; plain‚Äëtext, Swedish marketplace style.  
4. **Preview live** ‚Äî see the layout with a large hero image and a thumbnail strip.  
5. **Publish** ‚Äî open each marketplace with formatted text; mark **Klar** per platform, or **S√•ld** when done.

## Tech stack & versions
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, **Vanilla JavaScript (ES2020+)**
- **APIs:** `fetch` POST ‚Üí **/generate-description** (backend). Backend uses **Google Gemini API** for text generation.
- **Images:** **Canvas API** for client‚Äëside compression & rotation; **FileReader** for previews
- **Data:** **LocalStorage** for drafts (`avp3.drafts`) and marketplace state (`avp3.markets`)
- **Hosting:** **Vercel** (frontend). Backend currently on Render.
- **Performance:** No frameworks; minimal JS; images compressed before storing

> Backend base URL is configured via `<meta name="backend" content="https://‚Ä¶">` in `index.html`.

---

## Privacy
- No signup or server‚Äëside drafts; your **drafts and images stay in your browser**.  
- Only AI‚Äëgeneration requests hit the backend (`/generate-description`). No analytics by default.

## Roadmap
**Now**
- Lightbox rotation polish (maintain layout on rotate)
- Mobile layout: stacked panes and responsive preview sizing
- Logo icons for marketplaces from `/gallery/icons/*.svg`

**Next**
- Export/Import drafts (JSON)
- Autosave every 2 minutes (on change)
- ‚ÄúSet as cover‚Äù from preview strip + keyboard reordering

**Later**
- Direct publishing integrations (where ToS allows)
- Cloud sync for drafts
- More marketplaces & analytics

---

## What this is / isn‚Äôt
- **Is:** a speed‚Äëto‚Äëpublish tool that keeps everything **plain text & safe** for Swedish marketplaces.  
- **Isn‚Äôt:** a bulk bot, spam tool, or a data harvester. You still review and publish.

---

## Development
- Open `index.html` directly or serve statically.
- Configure backend URL via the `<meta name="backend">` tag.
- Keys used only by the backend (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

**Folders of note**
```
/screenshots         # Images used in this README
/gallery/icons       # Marketplace SVG icons (Tradera, Blocket, Facebook, eBay)
